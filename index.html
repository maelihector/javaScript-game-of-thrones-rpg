        <h2>Pick your path to conquer your enemies!</h2><br>
        <p>
          The goal of the game is to defeat all rival houses and sit alone on the Iron Throne!
        </p><br>
        <p>
          No matter who you choose as your player, each House is capable of defeating all remaining Houses, but only
          if you choose your battles in the correct order.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          Also, donâ€™t let health points fool you because attack and defense power
          (both hidden) vary and they are equally important.
