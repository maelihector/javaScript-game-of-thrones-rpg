# Game of Thrones RPG using JavaScript

## What is this?

This is a role playing game using [Game of Thrones](http://www.georgerrmartin.com/) characters. A user chooses one of five characters to be their player, the remaining four characters automatically become the player's enemies to defeat. The player then must choose the correct order of defeating all four enemies in order to have some health points left at the end of the game to win.

## How does it work?

1. The user is asked to pick their player out of five roles. 
2. The user is asked to pick the first opponent out of the four remaining roles. 
3. An attack button is displayed. The player then clicks on the attack button several times, watches how their scores changes accordingly, and either defeats the opponent, or gets defeated by the opponent. 
4. If opponent is defeated the player is able to choose their next opponent from the remaining enemies.

The game ends when either the player is defeated, when player and opponent defeat each other, or if the player defeats all four opponents.

- Each of the five roles have varying amount of health points, attack power, and counter attack power. 
- The user is able to defeat the game no matter which role they choose as their player as each role is able to defeat the four remaining roles given the order they are defeated is correct.
-  The player's attack player multiplies by the number of attacks the player has accumulated throughout the game therefore increasing their chances of winning if they choose to attack weak enemies first.
- JavaScript is in place to alter the counter attack power of some roles in order to add difficulty to the game.
